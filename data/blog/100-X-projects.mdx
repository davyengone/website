## Overview

Building a business is hard but fun. I'm a goal-oriented person but I have hard time
keeping focus for a long time. One way for me to keep such focus is to have small sprints,
run tons of experiments and quickly validate the validity of an idea.

Over the last 6 months, after filling for bankruptcy for my previous business, I've tried
many things with some degree of success and failures. The main learning I got from these
experiments is that shorts but intense sprints of 3 months can yield amazing results.

This is why I'm launching this 100 X Projects where 100 represents a constant and X a variable
that can reprensent days, hours, videos, piece of contents, ectera.

Here my the list of projects or goals that are part of the first 100X Projects:

## [Health] Run 100km per month for 12 months in the row

Being a father of a 1-year old boy, a boyfriend and an entrepreneur, I have hard time keeping up
with my daily running routine. Over the last 12 months, I averaged less than 100km per month.
Before this, I was averaging 250km per month. I would love to get back to that level but I think
that'll take some time.

**100km** per month as of Feb 1st 2022 for the next 12 months is my health target.

## [Business] Add 10K users on the Hackages Learning platform in 100 Days

Last year, with a small team, we built the [Hackages Learning Platform](https://app.hackages.io/). It's place where
developers can find unique workshop for 80€ maximum.

We grew the userbase to over 500 users in less than a month without any marketing growth technique.
The users love the experience. Beyond the workshop, the platform has some unique features like the TDD-style learning
environment that helps users get immidiate feedback on the code they wrote.

However, we ran out of money and had to slow down this project for a while. We're restarting it and we would like to
grow it to 10K users in **100 working days**.

We will document the techniques we will use to achieve this goal on this blog. Subscribe to get weekly updates about this goal.

## [Brand] Make 100 Youtube videos by 31/12/2022 on the Hackages Learning channel

Starting a Youtube channel is hard and keeping up with it is even harder. I've been struggling with keeping up with content
creation. However, we saw the results last year of feeding our Youtube channel with fresh content.

On this Youtube channel, we share awesome developers tips and tricks, refactoring code, add tests to projects without test coverage
and we publish podcasts. If you like that idea and the content we put out, you can subscribe [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWzOQjlbsWQ6PvRBoSRA7xg)
